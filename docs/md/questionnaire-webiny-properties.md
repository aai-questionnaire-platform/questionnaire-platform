# Updating properties to questionnaire created by end users

There are couple of parameters delivered along with webiny-models that can affect behaviour of game, which can't be updated with admin-frontend for now:

- Category: background_color, background_image, image
- Question: tags

These parameters can be updated using webiny's admin-ui, more information how to locate correct environment `[link removed]`.

After update, game-content should be published with admin-frontend.
