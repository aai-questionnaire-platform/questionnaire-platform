# Localization

Currently the user can't select the desired language, although the data models usually support locales. 

- Questinnaire admin: Locale is supported in Webiny data model only.
- Questionnaire factory: Locale is supported in assets/*app.json files, but not frontend support is provided.
- Dashboard: Frontend has locale support in src/locales/*json -files. Backend does not support different locales.
- Order: Frontend has locale support in src/locales/*json -files. Backend does not support different locales.
